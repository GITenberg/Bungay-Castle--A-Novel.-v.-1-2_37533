description: "Bungay Castle is a gothic novel by Elizabeth Bonh√¥te. It was first published\
  \ in 1796 and follows the fortunes of the De Morney family at Bungay Castle in Suffolk.\
  \ Two young members of the family, Roseline and Edwin, search for the source of\
  \ strange, unearthly cries and discover a terrifying secret in the castle's bowels\
  \ which will change their lives forever. The story combines the classic Gothic tropes\
  \ of mystery, betrayal and a heroine in peril in suitably imposing surroundings\
  \ and has been praised in modern times for its proto-feminist sensibility. The young\
  \ women in the story keep their fates in their own hands, rather than wait for some\
  \ dashing hero to come to the rescue.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
